# Apache-Kafka-Competitive-Coding-Analytics
This project simulates a real-time data processing system for competitive programming platforms using Apache Kafka. It ingests, processes, and analyzes structured submission events — such as problems, competitions, and solutions — to generate meaningful insights like top languages, hardest categories, leaderboards, and user ratings.
